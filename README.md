```
Then, run the following command using the command prompt from the folder of your project:

```
$ pod install

1. Open your project in Xcode.
2. Drag the SDK library files, and drop them into your project in the left navigator panel in Xcode. Select the option, `Copy items if needed`.
3. Select `File->Add files to 'project name'` and add the msso_config.json file from your project folder.
4. In Xcode "Build Setting‚Äù of your Project Target, add `-ObjC` for `Other Linker Flags`.
5. Import the following Mobile SDK library header file to the classes or to the .pch file if your project has one.

```
#import <MASFoundation/MASFoundation.h>
#import <MASUI/MASUI.h>
```
